# AnimeVerse API

Welcome to the **AnimeVerse API** documentation! 🚀

AnimeVerse provides a robust and easy-to-use API for managing user anime lists and preferences. This API works **alongside the [Jikan API](https://jikan.moe/)**, leveraging Jikan for anime discovery and browsing while providing secure user authentication, personalized list management, and smart caching to avoid rate limits.

## How It Works

The AnimeVerse API follows a **"Lazy Caching"** strategy:

1. **Discovery & Browsing**: Your frontend queries the Jikan API directly for anime search and details. This keeps browsing fast and avoids unnecessary backend calls.

2. **Saving to List**: When a user clicks "Save Anime," your frontend sends the anime details (fetched from Jikan) to `POST /v1/user_anime_list`. The API automatically caches the anime in the local database and links it to the user's list.

3. **Viewing Saved Lists**: When users view their profile or saved lists, queries go to `GET /v1/user_anime_list`, fetching data from the AnimeVerse database. This avoids Jikan rate limits and provides instant access to 100+ saved animes.

This hybrid approach gives you the best of both worlds: Jikan's comprehensive anime database for discovery, and AnimeVerse for secure, personalized user data management.

## Key Features

- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration with email verification and bcrypt password hashing.

- **Powerful Filtering**: Easily search and filter results by title, genre, and other criteria.
- **Modern Standards**: Built with RESTful principles, supporting standard HTTP methods and JSON responses.
- **Rate Limiting**: Fair usage enforcement with configurable limits to ensure system stability.
